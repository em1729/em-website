Emily is an aspiring R and art nerd and Webtoons fanatic. Or at least she strives to be. She spends most of her time reading aRticles, liking all the beautiful art work of others on Instagram, and getting pulled into the stories and art in comics. She currently works in local government and low-key loves it.
